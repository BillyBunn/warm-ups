# JavaScript Daily Warm-Up Exercises

A place to store my regular "warm-up" exercises. The intent is to build muscle memory on the core fundamentals of the language and as a JS developer in general. There is one "daily" warmup exercise and four more specific warm-ups to be cycled through.

## Warm-Ups

Navigate to the linked folders below for specifics on each warm-up exercise.

### 00 - [Daily Warmup][daily]

Work with arrays, functions, looping, and objects. Implement spread, deconstruction techniques along with map, filter and reduce.

### 01 - [The Holy Grail][holy grail]

Implement the "Holy Grail" web layout using Float, Flexbox, and Grid, adding some "flavor" on each subsequent iteration.

### 02 - [Express Server][express]

A qualified JS developer should be able to produce an express server "on demand"—this warm-up involves creating a basic express server, using TDD which utilizes the core express components (get, post, ejs, middleware).

### 03 - [Data Structures][dsa]

Every data structure has at its base, a means of traversal. Every data structure challenge/question/interview has at its base a requirement that you "do something" while traversing.

This warm-up exercise is intended to make the traversals trivial, so that I can focus solely on the logic that occurs during traversals to solve challenges.

### 04 - [Async][async]

One of the biggest strengths of Javascript is its use of and prowess at asynchronous actions. At the core of this is Promises and async/await.

This challenge requires the use of Promises and Async to fetch and transform remote data—actions which are done daily in production-level work.

## Credits

I based this routine on [assignments][original] created by my former instructor, [John Cokos][john's github], and adapted them for my own purposes.
