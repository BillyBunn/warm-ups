// Arrays

// Create an array of numbers, 1 through 10



// Write a function, called forLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a for(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.



// Write a function, called whileLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a while(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.



// Implement .map(), .filter(), .reduce() as regular javascript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.



// Objects

// Begin with the starter code below ...
const stuff = {
  tv: 'huge',
  radio: 'old',
  toothbrush: 'frayed',
  cars: ['Toyota','Mazda']
}

let state = {};

let newPeople = [];
const newStuff = {};
let newState = {};

// Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new array called newPeople', which is a copy of the people` array, with a person named 'Odie' added to the beginning and one named 'Garfield' added to the end.



// Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new object called newStuff', which is a copy of the stuffobject, with a new car added to the end of thecars` array within it



// Create a state object with keys of people and stuff that contain the people and stuff data.
// Do this using object destructuring assignment



// Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called newSate, repeating the newPeople and newStuff steps above but directly within the people and stuff nodes of the state object (don't just spread in newPeople and newStuff)



// Prove that the original people, stuff, and state are unchanged.
// const people = ['Kookla','Fran','Ollie'];
